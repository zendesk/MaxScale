[\fIOPTIONS...\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The MariaDB Corporation MaxScale is an intelligent proxy that allows forwarding of
database statements to one or more database servers using complex rules,
a semantic understanding of the database statements and the roles of
the various servers within the backend cluster of databases.

MaxScale is designed to provide load balancing and high availability
functionality transparently to the applications. In addition it provides
a highly scalable and flexible architecture, with plugin components to
support different protocols and routing decisions.
