/** \mainpage MaxScale by MariaDB Corporation

The MariaDB Corporation MaxScale is an intelligent proxy that allows forwarding of
database statements to one or more database servers using complex rules,
a semantic understanding of the database statements and the roles of
the various servers within the backend cluster of databases.

MaxScale is designed to provide load balancing and high availability
functionality transparently to the applications. In addition it provides
a highly scalable and flexible architecture, with plugin components to
support different protocols and routing decisions.

MaxScale is implemented in C and makes extensive use of the
asynchronous I/O capabilities of the Linux operating system. The epoll
system is used to provide the event driven framework for the input and
output via sockets.

The protocols are implemented as external shared object modules which
can be loaded at runtime. These modules support a fixed interface,
communicating the entries points via a structure consisting of a set of
function pointers. This structure is called the "module object".

The code that routes the queries to the database servers is also loaded
as external shared objects and are referred to as routing modules.

An Google Group exists for MaxScale that can be used to discuss ideas,
issues and communicate with the MaxScale community.

\section Documentation

For information about installing and using MaxScale, please refer to the 
documentation. It is in Markdown format.

You can point your browser to the MaxScale project at GitHub.  Look
inside the "Documentation" directory, where you will find a file named
Documentation-Contents.md. Click on that, and GitHub will show the
documentation in its intended display format.  The contents page lists
the available documents and has links to them.

If you do not want to rely on the internet, then clone the project
from GitHub - either the entire project or just the Documentation folder.
Then point your browser to the Documentation-Contents.md file in your
local file system and proceed as above.
